# China Visits

I have made responsive graphic page using data visuals for Chinses heads of government from 1997 to early 2020 and the countries they visited alonwith the purpose of visit. 

Wen Jiabao, the premier of the Republic of China made the maximum number if visits followed by his general secratary Hu Jintao. Wen Jiabao made maximum trips for Shanghai Cooperation Organisation and ASEAN. Both leaders were liked by the Chinsese citizens during their administration from 2002-2013. 

I have used the data set made available by Yu Wang and Randall W. Stone. The dataset records 400+ visits by Chinaâ€™s presidents and premiers to 100+ countries.

I have cleaned the data using pandas, used Datawrapper for data visualization, and Adobe Illustrator for ai2html responsive graphic. The page is graphic responsive ie when the screen gets smaller, the columns collapse to be on top of one another.
